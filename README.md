## 📘 Java Servlet & JSP Experiments (8.1 – 8.3)

This repository contains three Java web-based experiments implemented using **Servlets**, **JSP**, and **JDBC**, as part of the ByteXL lab exercises.

Each experiment demonstrates key concepts of web application development using Java EE.

### 🔹 **Experiment 8.1 – User Login Using Servlet and HTML Form**

**Objective:**
To develop a Java Servlet that accepts user credentials via an HTML form and displays a personalized welcome message upon successful login.

**Key Learning Points:**

* Form handling using `request.getParameter()`.
* Request–response lifecycle in Servlets.
* Dynamic HTML generation using `PrintWriter`.

### 🔹 **Experiment 8.2 – Display Employee Records with JDBC and Servlet Integration**

**Objective:**
To integrate JDBC with a Java Servlet to fetch and display employee records from a database. Includes search functionality for retrieving employee details by ID.

**Key Learning Points:**

* Connecting Servlets with a MySQL database using JDBC.
* Executing SQL queries and processing `ResultSet`.
* Displaying dynamic data in HTML tables.

### 🔹 **Experiment 8.3 – Student Attendance Portal Using JSP and Servlet**

**Objective:**
To design a simple student attendance management portal using JSP for the frontend and a Servlet for backend processing and data insertion into a database.

**Key Learning Points:**

* Using JSP as the presentation layer.
* Handling form submissions in a Servlet.
* Inserting form data into a database using JDBC.
* Demonstrating MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern concepts.
